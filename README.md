# DemoCalculator

This is a fun little project to help me with confirming my calculations for time fuse lengths and deliberate charges 
used within the CAF. Although these calculations are also done by hand, having the formulas in code 
can allow me to use this web page and hopefully soon a mobile app in order to confirm the correct amount of charges
and time fuse needed for an explosive charge.

*Currently using node JS for calcs*
